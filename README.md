# Random Quote Machine

This project was completed as part of the Free Code Camps Front End Libraries Assignment.

This project was created using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim of the project was to create an random quote machine using react and work with the features that React presents. This was done by fetching data from a JSON file and then using state to update all the inforamtion either on a timer or when the user clicks.
